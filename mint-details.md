# Mint Details

Tripped EthTerrestrials will mint on our website [https://www.ethterrestrials.io/](https://www.ethterrestrials.io). Each EthTerrestrial will be randomly created on-chain and should "reveal" shortly after your mint. &#x20;

**Maximum Mintable Tokens:** 4169

**Price:** 0.14 ether

**Maximum mints per transaction:** 10

**Wallet limit:** None

**Allowlist:** None

**Team premint:** The team will be preminting no more than 40 Tripped ETHTerrestrials.

**"One of one" tokens:** One of ones will not be distributed until after completion of the mint. After the public mint is sold out, each of the 11 "one of one" tokens will be distributed to random owners of Tripped EthTerrestrials using random numbers generated by Chainlink VRF. The "one of one" token with the attribute "???" will originally be a placeholder, the holder of this token holds the ability to suggest an idea for what the art for this "one of one" should be. Kye will then create the art based off of the idea given, the placeholder will then be replaced with this new art and locked. If this token is transferred to a new owner before the placeholder is replaced and locked the previous owner's idea will be scrapped.   &#x20;

**No roadmap:**  EthTerrestrials is an innovative on-chain art project and has no roadmap.&#x20;
