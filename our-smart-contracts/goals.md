# Goals

In designing our NFT's smart contracts, we sought to achieve the following goals:

* 100% On-chain art with no external dependencies
* Gas efficiency upon minting
* Composability of our artwork and your NFTs
* Open Source
* Highly resistant against brute-force attacks (i.e., "forced rarity" attacks).
* Legible and well documented

We have exposed most of our contracts' function calls as `public` in order to encourage the most flexible onchain compositions that may be possible.&#x20;

You are encouraged to review the source of our contracts, as we only discuss the most pertinent features.
