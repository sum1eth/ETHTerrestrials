# EthTerrestrials

## Lore

In early 2021, a young artist named Kye discovered an Inter-Dimensional species of aliens who came to Earth’s internet to infuse consciousness into all other pixelated lifeforms.&#x20;

Kye drew 100 of these pixelated Masters of the Metaverse, each with unique technology and attributes, which you may find familiar since they passed their traits and personality down to their 8-bit babies (the CryptoPunks).&#x20;

In late 2021, Kye discovered a newer, higher resolution species of EthTerrestrials approaching Earth's internet. These super advanced aliens demanded that Kye and his friends insert them and their 24x24 pixel parental units directly into the Ethereum blockchain....

## Origin



The first 100 ETH Ts were release on March 8th, 2021, during what many would consider the first wave of the NFT renaissance. The Cryptopunk floor had just recently expanded to 20 ETH for the first time, and there were only a handful of punk like PFP projects yet to be released, most of which were literal derivatives. One of the first follow up PFP projects to achieve success was Cyberkongz. In the wake of their 1000 Ape like avatars, Kye decided to launch an even more rare Alien inspired collection.

&#x20;Kye, then 16 years old and feeling isolated at his South African Boarding school, had found solace and inspiration in the punks discord community. During those days, the Crytpopunks channel of the larva labs discord was the epicenter of the entire NFT world. Now it’s almost impossible to navigate discord and NFT Twitter but anyone who was here in Feb/March of 2021 knows there was only one place you had to go. It was like a town in the Old West and Punks chat was the only Saloon.&#x20;

On the day Kye launched ETH Ts, they immediately sold out, and almost every active punk owner in the chat changed their profile picture to the “aliens”. Now we see this phenomenon happen anytime a new project comes out, but back then it was rare to change your pfp away from your punk, unless it was for something really special. Seeing all the people he looked up to the most support his art changed Kye’s journey forever. For the first time in his young life, he believed.
