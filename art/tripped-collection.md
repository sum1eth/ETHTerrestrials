# Tripped Collection

## Specimens

The Tripped EthTerrestrials collection consists of 4169 technologically advanced beings. These aliens are beamed up into the Ethereum blockchain upon mint, and are generated directly on the blockchain from a selection of over 150 traits, delivered to your browser as an SVG image.&#x20;

Each of these traits is stored entirely within the EthTerrestrials smart contract. No external servers are required.&#x20;

There will be 11 custom created (non generative) "one of one" tokens.&#x20;
