# OG Collection

## Specimens

The 100 OG EthTerrestrials are 24x24 pixel art images, consisting of 97 still and 3 animated images. These OGs were initially hosted on the OpenSea Shared Storefront contract after arriving on Earth in 2021.

## Technology

The Mothership has come to take the OGs back home and replace their earthly presence with upgraded technology that can survive inside the blockchain.&#x20;

Each owner of an OG EthTerrestrial can upgrade their OG token to a new 100% on-chain token hosted on our custom smart contract.

## How to Beam Up

In order to migrate your OG EthTerrestrials, use the 'Beam Up' button on [ethterrestrials.io](https://www.ethterrestrials.io). After transactions are completed, your OG EthTerrestrials will be transferred from the original contract (Open Sea Shared contract) to the new EthTerrestrial contract where they will be completely on-chain and live happily with all other EthTerrestrials.
